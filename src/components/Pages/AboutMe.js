    <h4>Personal Statement</h4>
    <p>
      Having completed my academic studies, I am now looking forward to continuing improving my front end development skills in a 
      professional environment. From my studies, I have gained in depth knowledge of front end web development, object oriented 
      programming and programming principles such as creating reactive web pages that have a user centred design while following 
      accessibility guidelines and principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have studied through the Open University, allowing me to gain many transferable skills such as problem solving, personal 
      accountability, reliability and time management during independent learning or while working alongside my peers. This experience 
      has meant I have been able to develop my skills through focusing on what I needed to practice, catering my learning 
      to my strengths. While my studies are now complete,  having gained a BSc with Honours in Computing, IT and Design, I have since 
      spent time developing new skills using frameworks, libraries or languages I lacked experience in. Additionally, I have conducted 
      freelance work, creating a B2B company website for <a href='https://wadebuildingservices.co.uk/'>Wade Building Services</a>. To do this, 
      I worked  alongside a sales department 
      (to determine branding) and technical department (for functional aspects), giving me the experience of handling multiple stakeholders 
      throughout a project.
